The queue of cars entering Dnipro from Kharkiv today is 6km (3.7 miles) long.
We know, because we drove along it.
All the number plates show they come from Ukraine’s second city, which is now under daily bombardment by Russian troops.
These are families who spent the past week in bunkers and basements, now gathering their nerves and making a dash out of their city and to safety.
I just saw a white rescue service minibus full of children.
As the column of cars creeps towards the entrance to Dnipro, they reach sandbags and tyres piled into walls by locals and soldiers, and metal ‘hedgehog’ crosses and boulders to try to stop any advancing Russian tanks.
There are teams digging trenches through the fields.
At one spot I saw men with a bright yellow Lada car and trailer filling white sacks with rubble and sand.
There are checkpoints all along the road now, manned by police and soldiers, Ukrainian flags flying above.
Inside Dnipro, life has been transformed in just a week.
Families who haven’t left to head west yet are now dashing back and forth to their basements when the eerie air raid siren wails.
This morning, I dropped in to see a woman we met last week, and she showed me how her husband and neighbours are working to make the basement of their block as comfy as possible.
There are mattresses and camp beds, even rugs on the dusty concrete, and supplies of food - including for people’s pets.
It’s all utterly abnormal.
But even now, Anna told me how teachers in Dnipro are trying to distract children, and probably themselves, by running Zoom classes between the city’s bunkers.
Today’s timetable includes science, Ukrainian language and yoga.
