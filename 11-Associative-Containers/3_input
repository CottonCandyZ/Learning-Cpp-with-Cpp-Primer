Geography is at the heart of this story.
Ukraine's position between Russia to the east and countries such as Poland and Romania to the west means it straddles both the European and Russian spheres of influence.
This is a major reason why tensions are so high. Russia has long resisted Ukraine's move towards the European Union.
But geography is also key to how the invasion played out. Moscow, after all, mounted its attacks via air, land and sea.
